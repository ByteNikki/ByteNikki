- 👋 Hi, I’m @ByteNikki
- 👀 I’m interested in hidden insights from data's labyrinth, like a digital Sherlock Holmes solving mysteries in a world of numbers and spreadsheets.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the art of turning data into stories that captivate and inform.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on data-driven odysseys. Whether it's deciphering the secrets of a dataset or building predictive models.
- 📫 How to reach me - Feel free to send me a digital owl at swarnanikhitha21@gmail.com.
